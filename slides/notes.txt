I want to present a messaging queue (or bus) in rust. JohnMQ.

Remark: it is still work in progress and not production ready.  Contributions
are welcome :) Actually I'm looking for a few collaborators.

Why having a high-performance and reliable messaging bus is important?  I will
tell you my story.

# microservices:
================

Microservices.

A relatively new fashionable word in a software development world.  If you
don't know what it is, then you can google it and read an article from Martin
Fowler.

# monolith-vs-micro:
====================

I have been through a bunch of huge monolithic code bases already. It doesn't
feel good and great to work with. Deploy is a pain, bug hunting is a pain, one
tests run takes way too long. And complexity never stops increasing.
